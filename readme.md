Just discussing a potential collaborative pack in coda.

Its goal would be to have easy-to-grab tables that are maintained and up to date. Instead of hundreds of users making their own versions of every table - Hundreds of users can collaborate on the same tables!

So there'd only be objective information and somewhat static information. For example currency names and abbreviations would be good - But not the ever changing rates
